1. I took an intro to web development class 5 years ago, but have not built a web site from scratch since. Currently, I need to build a website for a documentary I am filming, so I am taking this class as a refresher.

2. I would like to learn basic coding, and web designs basics so I can make my website look aesthetically pleasing.

3. I uploaded a photo of a red-tailed hawk becuase they are my favorite bird and I have seen an unusally large amount of them this year.
